# Utility tools

### Visualizing X events

[xev](https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man1/xev.1.html) is a command-line tool that setups a toy window and prints all incoming X events. It is a very useful tool to experiment with when trying to determine which events are sent upon which actions.

### Keyboard configuration

[xmodmap](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.1/doc/xmodmap.1.html) allows one to query information about various input-related keyboard elements. Notably, it lists all the keycodes and corresponding key symbols as interpreted by the X Server.
